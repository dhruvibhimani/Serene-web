WHAT IS SERENE??


A college  project developed by me and my friends ,which totally includes features which an  app would include for women's safety .This site is an idea that how an app can be created to decrease the crime rates that never tend to decrease . 
SERENE is a web-based safety solution designed to enhance women's safety by providing emergency alerts, real-time location tracking, and smart threat detection. The primary objective of this project was to build a mobile application; however, due to time constraints during development, we opted to create a web version first as a working proof of concept.
Despite the limitations, SERENE Web demonstrates the core features and vision of the original idea. I plan to complete and convert this concept into a fully functional mobile app using Flutter in the near future.S
